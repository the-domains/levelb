Red Falls

Red Falls is the code name for my game project that I've been building in RPG Maker for the last year and a half.

Max, a late teenager, and his friends set off to uncover the mystery surrounding Max's grandfathers disappearance. Their journey takes them into the local folklore of their hometown and the deep woods that surround it. I'm aiming for RPG/Light horror. This is a work in progress and I hope to collaborate with other artists on this project as well. The art style is to be determined at this time. I'm building the game with the preset sprites at this time, and when the game is complete, I will swap them out for a custom sprite
