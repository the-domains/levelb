# Red Falls, MA

For the last year and a half or so, I've been working on a game project solo. The engine I'm using is RPG maker now, MV. It's been a very slow and not so steady project up to this point. Here are some details on the story I'm developing.

Max, a late teenager who's dealing with the mysterious disappearance of his grandfather. Max and his friends begin to dive into the enigma that leads them into local folklore and a place they never thought was possible. 

Code name "Red Falls," is a RPG and light horror style game. I'm doing my best to make sure it doesn't become a visual novel, though that doesn't sound too bad either. My original concept for visuals were going to be pixel characters. ![Ben.  One of Max's 4 friends in the search party.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d4f0b4c1-1028-4f98-a65d-5f1fa89b8950.png)
