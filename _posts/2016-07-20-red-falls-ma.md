# Red Falls, MA

For the last year and a half or so, I've been working on a game project solo. The engine I'm using is RPG maker now, MV. It's been a very slow and not so steady project up to this point. Here are some details on the story I'm developing.

Max, a late teenager who's dealing with the mysterious disappearance of his grandfather. Max and his friends begin to dive into the enigma that leads them into local folklore and a place they never thought was possible. 

Code name "Red Falls," is a RPG and light horror style game. I'm doing my best to make sure it doesn't become a visual novel, though that doesn't sound too bad either. My original concept for visuals were going to be pixel characters. 

I'm toying with the idea to keep it in the pixel style, or go with the anime style characters used in the RPG Maker engine. The characters colors and clothing will be recreated. ![Ben.  One of Max's 4 friends in the search party.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d4f0b4c1-1028-4f98-a65d-5f1fa89b8950.png)
